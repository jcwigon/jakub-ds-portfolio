# Premier League Statistics Analysis (2021–2025)

*Date of creation: 2025-06-27*

## Project description

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of data from the English Premier League for the 2021–2025 seasons. The aim was to go through the entire data workflow – from acquisition, through processing and analysis, to visualization of results – using modern programming tools and NoSQL solutions.

**Key components of the project:**

- **NoSQL database:** I used MongoDB to store, efficiently search, and analyze match data. The project also demonstrates how to run queries on a NoSQL database and perform data analysis directly in MongoDB.
- **Python modules and classes:** The codebase is structured as modular Python files and classes, ensuring a clear and easily expandable program architecture.
- **Data acquisition (Open Data):** Match results and statistics were sourced from open data repositories.
- **Data analysis in Pandas:** I performed data exploration, aggregation, and statistical calculations using the Pandas library.
- **Data visualization:** Key findings and trends are presented as clear and informative charts generated in Python.

Through this project, I demonstrate in practice how to build custom Python modules, define classes, use NoSQL databases, acquire data from open sources, as well as analyze and search a MongoDB database, and present results in a clear visual form.

Additionally, as a football enthusiast, I have prepared interesting analyses that answer questions such as:
- Do referees favor home teams?
- Does home advantage really matter?
- Which teams committed the most fouls in particular seasons?
- Is the Premier League becoming more attacking-oriented each year?
- Based on available data, I have also calculated a simplified, popular in modern football xG (Expected Goals) metric.
