# About Me

Hi!  
I'm Jakub Cwigo≈Ñ ‚Äì an experienced process engineer and industrial engineer with many years of experience in the manufacturing sector, including automotive and modern assembly line environments. Over the years, I have specialized in process optimization, implementing new technologies (including AI camera systems and automated image analysis), automation, and production efficiency analysis.

I hold an MSc in Production Management Engineering.  
In recent years, data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence have become my true passion. I completed postgraduate studies in Data Science and am actively developing my skills in Data Science, Python, Machine Learning, and predictive modeling ‚Äì especially at the intersection of industry and data analytics.

I am constantly looking for practical applications of modern analytics to solve real-world problems in factories and in more general projects. I believe the future of industry lies in combining engineering experience with data science and AI.
