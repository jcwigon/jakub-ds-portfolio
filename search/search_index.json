The aim was to go through the entire data workflow \u2013 from acquisition, through processing and analysis, to visualization of results \u2013 using modern programming tools and NoSQL solutions.</p> <p>Key components of the project:</p> <ul> <li>NoSQL database: I used MongoDB to store, efficiently search, and analyze match data. The project also demonstrates how to run queries on a NoSQL database and perform data analysis directly in MongoDB.</li> <li>Python modules and classes: The codebase is structured as modular Python files and classes, ensuring a clear and easily expandable program architecture.</li> <li>Data acquisition (Open Data): Match results and statistics were sourced from open data repositories.</li> <li>Data analysis in Pandas: I performed data exploration, aggregation, and statistical calculations using the Pandas library.</li> <li>Data visualization: Key findings and trends are presented as clear and informative charts generated in Python.</li> </ul> <p>Through this project, I demonstrate in practice how to build custom Python modules, define classes, use NoSQL databases, acquire data from open sources, as well as analyze and search a MongoDB database, and present results in a clear visual form.</p> <p>Additionally, as a football enthusiast, I have prepared interesting analyses that answer questions such as:</p> <ul> <li>Do referees favor home teams?</li> <li>Does home advantage really matter?</li> <li>Which teams committed the most fouls in particular seasons?</li> <li>Is the Premier League becoming more attacking-oriented each year?</li> <li>Based on available data, I have also calculated a simplified, popular in modern football xG (Expected Goals) metric.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/second-project/","title":"Second Project","text":"<p>\"# Second Project\" </p>"}]}
