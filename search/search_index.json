The aim was to go through the entire data workflow \u2013 from acquisition, through processing and analysis, to visualization of results \u2013 using modern programming tools and NoSQL solutions.</p> <p>Key components of the project:</p> <ul> <li>NoSQL database: I used MongoDB to store, efficiently search, and analyze match data. The project also demonstrates how to run queries on a NoSQL database and perform data analysis directly in MongoDB.</li> <li>Python modules and classes: The codebase is structured as modular Python files and classes, ensuring a clear and easily expandable program architecture.</li> <li>Data acquisition (Open Data): Match results and statistics were sourced from open data repositories.</li> <li>Data analysis in Pandas: I performed data exploration, aggregation, and statistical calculations using the Pandas library.</li> <li>Data visualization: Key findings and trends are presented as clear and informative charts generated in Python.</li> </ul> <p>Through this project, I demonstrate in practice how to build custom Python modules, define classes, use NoSQL databases, acquire data from open sources, as well as analyze and search a MongoDB database, and present results in a clear visual form.</p> <p>Additionally, as a football enthusiast, I have prepared interesting analyses that answer questions such as:</p> <ul> <li>Do referees favor home teams?</li> <li>Does home advantage really matter?</li> <li>Which teams committed the most fouls in particular seasons?</li> <li>Is the Premier League becoming more attacking-oriented each year?</li> <li>Based on available data, I have also calculated a simplified, popular in modern football xG (Expected Goals) metric.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/premier-league-stats-2021-2025-analysis/#skills","title":"Skills","text":"<ul> <li>Python </li> <li>Pandas </li> <li>Matplotlib </li> <li>MongoDB </li> <li>MkDocs </li> <li>Git </li> <li>Visual Studio Code </li> <li>Open Data </li> </ul>"},{"location":"projects/premier-league-stats-2021-2025-analysis/#project-structure","title":"Project structure","text":"<p>The project is organized into several Python modules and scripts, each responsible for a specific part of the analysis workflow:</p> <ul> <li>main.py \u2013 Entry point of the project; runs the full data analysis pipeline.</li> <li>analiza.py \u2013 Functions for data exploration and cleaning.</li> <li>statystyki.py \u2013 Computes match and season statistics.</li> <li>wizualizacje.py \u2013 Generates plots and visual summaries.</li> <li>pobieranie.py \u2013 Downloads data from open data sources.</li> <li>mongodb_analiza.py \u2013 Analysis and querying of the MongoDB NoSQL database.</li> <li>mongo_utworz_baze.py \u2013 Script for creating and populating the MongoDB database.</li> <li>requirements.txt \u2013 List of required Python packages.</li> <li>README.md \u2013 Project documentation and setup instructions.</li> <li>.csv files \u2013 Example input datasets.</li> </ul> <p>All modules are well documented, and the code follows a modular structure for clarity and easy maintenance.</p>"},{"location":"projects/premier-league-stats-2021-2025-analysis/#project-workflow","title":"Project Workflow","text":""},{"location":"projects/premier-league-stats-2021-2025-analysis/#main-analysis-script","title":"Main analysis script","text":"<p>You can download the complete code and Jupyter notebook for this project here:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"projects/premier-league-stats-2021-2025-analysis/#analysis-visualizations","title":"Analysis Visualizations","text":""},{"location":"projects/premier-league-stats-2021-2025-analysis/#1-average-goals-per-match-by-season","title":"1.
